# quizz_app
quizz_app is a simple quiz app developed using flutter. The main feature of this app is that it displays 'check mark' (for correct answers) and a 'cross mark' (for wrong answers) after each question the user attempts.
This app helped me to learn more about lists and also helped me gain more information on how to modularize the code by implementing basic principles of Object Oriented Programming .
